This repository contains scripts necessary to run an in silico optimization process for endosomal escape peptides (EEPs), including featurization, training for predictive and generative models, implementation of genetic algorithm for random mutagenesis, etc. The eep_predictor and eep_optimizer files were modified from the scripts provide by [Schissel et al (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-021-00766-3).
